{will_paginate}[http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/tree/agnostic].

+per_page+, +previous_page+ and +total_entries+ in Sinatra views out of the box.

== Authors and credits

Leaf is based on {will_paginate}[http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/] which 
was originally written by PJ Hyett, who later handed over development to Mislav 
MarohniÄ‡. (The library was completely rewritten since then.)

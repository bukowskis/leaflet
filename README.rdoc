== Example usage

== Authors and credits

Leaf is heavily based on the agnostic branch of 
{will_paginate}[http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/tree/agnostic]. 
will_paginate was originally written by PJ Hyett, who later handed over 
development to Mislav MarohniÄ‡. (The library was completely rewritten since then.)
